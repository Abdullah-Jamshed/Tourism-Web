                <h4>K2 Mountain Range</h4>
                <p>K2 is a magnificent snow-covered mountain that reflects the powerful might of nature in all of its
                    glory, making it marvellous and terrifying at the same time. It is the second-highest mountain in
                    the entire world reaching an unfathomable height of 28,253 feet (8,612 metres). K2 is often referred
                    to as the ‘Savage Mountain’ because it is an excruciatingly difficult ascent with one of the highest
                    prevailing fatality rates for all climbers who dare to climb it. Despite its unconquerable terrain
                    and unpredictable weather patterns, it appeals to climbers from all over the world. Even though it
                    is located on the Pakistan-China border, climbers prefer to climb it from Pakistan’s side as it is
                    more conducive to the activity. Even if you don’t aspire to join its summit, just the mere spectacle
                    of this mighty mountain is a perspective-altering experience that allows you to completely become
                    immersed in the all-encompassing magnificence of mother nature.</p>

                <p>The Trango tower, located in the Baltoro Glacier region present in the Gilgit-Baltistan territory,
                    is the most spectacular vertical alpine climb in the entire world. It has intrigued and inspired
                    alpine climbers from all over the world to achieve its nearly impossible ascent to the top. Against
                    the backdrop of the mighty mountain ranges of the Karakorum, the Trango Tower stands erect with all
                    the unfaltering pride and greatness of a Greek God. It is a mesmerizing sight and an arduous climb
                    as it is completely vertical and its sheer magnificence makes it stand out amidst the entire range
                    of peaks that surround it.</p>

                <h4>Deosai Plains</h4>
                <p> The breathtaking Deosai plateau enjoys the status of one of the highest plateaus in the world.
                    Reaching 13,497 feet above sea level, it is approximately 30 kilometres away from the town of Skardu
                    (Baltistan region). It is given all sorts of magical names, such as ‘fairyland,’ and this is because
                    it constitutes one of the richest biodiversity, in the form of flora and fauna, in the entire world.
                    Its beauty is absolutely mind-blowing in the summer months when millions of wildflowers paint the
                    valley a multitude of bright colours that give it the effect of a mystical paradise. The locals
                    believe that the beauty of the land is conducive to magical supernatural fairies that wander about
                    freely taking inspiration from the landscape. There are crystal blue rivers and streams that cleanse
                    the soul of all stress and anxiety against the backdrop of lime green hills and meadows. The Deosai
                    plains make it hard to believe that heaven is not a place on earth.</p>

                <h4>Ansoo Lake</h4>
                <p>A marvel rests amidst towering peaks in the Kaghan Valley called Ansoo Lake, which is shaped exactly
                    like a teardrop at the tantalizing height of 13, 927 feet. The trek that leads to this exotic
                    location is slightly difficult but anyone who has made the journey has returned both gratified and
                    stunned. The reason Ansoo Lake is so special is because the entire lake is so accurately shaped like
                    a teardrop while simultaneously existing at a height at which water bodies do not usually exist,
                    making it a miracle in more ways than one. It is one of the most famous and mesmerizing natural
                    wonders that exist in the north, making it the crown jewel of the Kaghan Valley.

                <p> Saif-ul-Malook is a crystal clear lake engulfed by gigantic glaciers and immersed in some of the
                    most intriguing folklore in Pakistan. It is at an altitude of 10,578 feet and is one of the most
                    majestic tourist spots in the Kaghan Valley, attracting people from all over the world to
                    contemplate its beauty and revel in its glory. The lake is shrouded in mystery because up until
                    today, no one has ever been able to determine its depth and it is believed that anyone who dares to
                    swim in it drowns almost immediately. Its beauty is so intense that it sometimes becomes terrifying
                    under the radiance of a starlit sky that is immaculately reflected by the crystal clear water. It is
                    believed to have fairies living in the glaciers that surround it and is the backdrop against which
                    the famous fable of the prince of Egypt, Saif-ul-Malook, and the fairy queen, Badi-ul-Jamal, took
                    place.

                <h4>Attabad Lake</h4>
                <p>Attabad Lake is a glorious and pristine body of water located in the middle of nowhere and
                    surrounded by the mountainous terrain of the Hunza Valley region. It is as still as an ancient tree
                    and the blue of the water puts the sky to shame. Its creation is wrapped in tragedy and loss as it
                    is the result of a landslide that drowned an entire village by the name of Gojal Village. However,
                    although people feel sombre for this loss of life, the creation of this divine body of water
                    inspires them with the utmost reverence and awe.</p>

                <h4>Princess Of Hope</h4>
                <p> Along the Makran Coast Highway, there is a dazzling sculpture carved out of natural rock and mud
                    that has been marvellously sculpted out of the skilled hands of nature itself. Due to the strong
                    winds emanating from the Arabian Sea in the Balochistan region, this masterpiece stands as tall and
                    proud as a princess of a great kingdom. The name ‘Princess of Hope’ was given to this magnificent
                    natural sculpture by Angelina Jolie on her visit to Pakistan.

                <p>Pakistan is famous for its monumental glaciers made purely out of ice located at the core of some of
                    the most extreme mountain ranges in the country These white castles of nature are inspiring as well
                    as extremely difficult to reach even though the magnificent view is worth every hardship you may
                    encounter to get there. The Baltoro Glacier is located in the Karakorum Range at an elevation of
                    13,895 feet and is 63 kilometres long, making it the second-longest non-polar glacier in the entire
                    world. Trekking through it is like experiencing an ice age – you’ll be completely overwhelmed by
                    every aspect of the glacier on a physical, mental and emotional level.</p>
